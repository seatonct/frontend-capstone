WHAT GIFTGRABBER DOES:

GiftGrabber allows a user to create, edit, and delete wish lists.

Users can add items (at least the name of the item) to lists they create and may include a description, price, picture url, and online store url for the item.

Users can edit and delete items from lists they created but not from other users' lists.

Users can search for lists created by another user by searching that user's email address.

Users can view lists and item details added by other users but may not alter or delete them.

Users can claim items in any list to purchase and give to the list's subject.

All items a user has claimed from any list may be viewed in the user's shopping list.

A claim a user has made on an item can be undone by that user.

Items already claimed by a user may not be claimed by any other user.

If the user created a wishlist for themself, items in the list do not display claim options or information.

WHY GIFTGRABBER IS USEFUL:

Gift grabber allows users to easily share with others items list subjects would like to receive for Christmas, Birthdays, etc.

The claim feature ensures that an item will only be purchased by a single gift-giver, eliminating duplicate gifts.

A user can also make a wishlist for themself without inadvertently finding out which items they will be receiving, thus maintaining some element of surprise.
